=Description=

This plugin converts an input type text in a geolocation widget.
The widget can be used to let the users specify the city and country they reside
just by typing the city name. The widget will show a list of maching places around
the world and will let the user choose the appropiate combination of city/country.

The widget will store a unique identifier of the place called WOEID (Where On Earth ID)
and a country iso in two hidden fields. The WOEID is the standard way to identify places inside
the Yahoo geo apis, that means that you can extract a lot of information
of the places just by asking to the yahoo geo apis and passing the WOEID.
